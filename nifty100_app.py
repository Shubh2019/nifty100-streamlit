ChatGPT said:
This code performs exploratory analysis on a movie review dataset (reviews_filtered_df). Here's a line-by-line breakdown of what it does:

🧾 Step-by-Step Explanation:
# Count reviews per movie
review_counts = reviews_filtered_df.groupby('id').size().reset_index(name='reviewCount')
✅ This line groups the dataset by the movie id and counts how many reviews each movie has.
The result is a DataFrame called review_counts with two columns:

id: Movie identifier

reviewCount: Number of reviews for that movie

# Categorize movies into groups
review_counts['ReviewCategory'] = review_counts['reviewCount'].apply(
    lambda x: '> 4 reviews' if x > 4 else '≤ 4 reviews'
)
✅ Adds a new column called ReviewCategory that classifies each movie based on the number of reviews:

If a movie has more than 4 reviews → it's labeled '> 4 reviews'

Otherwise → it's labeled '≤ 4 reviews'

This helps segment movies into "popular" vs "less reviewed".

# Count how many movies fall in each category
category_counts = review_counts['ReviewCategory'].value_counts().reset_index()
category_counts.columns = ['ReviewCategory', 'MovieCount']
✅ Counts how many movies fall into each category (> 4 reviews and ≤ 4 reviews).
Then resets the index and renames columns for clarity:

ReviewCategory: The label (> 4 reviews or ≤ 4 reviews)

MovieCount: Number of movies in that category

🔍 Outcome:
The final output category_counts is a simple summary table showing:


ReviewCategory	MovieCount
> 4 reviews	XX
≤ 4 reviews	YY
You can use this to quickly assess how many movies are well-reviewed vs sparsely reviewed — often a crucial step in filtering or stratifying data for recommendation systems or modeling.

Let me know if you want to visualize it too!

You said:
# Step 1: Count number of reviews per critic (identified by criticName)

# Step 2: Get only critics with more than 4 reviews
frequent_critics = critic_counts[critic_counts['reviewCount'] > 4]['criticName']

# Step 3: Filter the main dataset to only include those critics
reviews_filtered_df = reviews_enriched_df[reviews_enriched_df['criticName'].isin(frequent_critics)].copy()
print(f"Original reviews: {reviews_enriched_df.shape[0]}")

ChatGPT said:
This code is focused on filtering the dataset to retain only reliable or active critics — those who have reviewed more than 4 movies. Here's the full breakdown:

🧾 Step-by-Step Explanation
# Step 1: Count number of reviews per critic (identified by criticName)
critic_counts = reviews_enriched_df.groupby('criticName').size().reset_index(name='reviewCount')
✅ This groups the dataset (reviews_enriched_df) by criticName and counts how many reviews each critic has submitted.
It results in a DataFrame critic_counts with:

criticName: Unique name or identifier of the critic

reviewCount: Total number of reviews written by that critic

# Step 2: Get only critics with more than 4 reviews
frequent_critics = critic_counts[critic_counts['reviewCount'] > 4]['criticName']
✅ Filters out critics who have reviewed more than 4 movies.
frequent_critics is a Series containing only the names of such critics — i.e., those considered "frequent" or "reliable".

# Step 3: Filter the main dataset to only include those critics
reviews_filtered_df = reviews_enriched_df[reviews_enriched_df['criticName'].isin(frequent_critics)].copy()
✅ Filters the main reviews dataset to include only rows where the critic name is in the list of frequent critics.

The .copy() ensures a clean slice (to avoid SettingWithCopyWarning from pandas).

print(f"Original reviews: {reviews_enriched_df.shape[0]}")
print(f"Filtered reviews (by critics with >4 reviews): {reviews_filtered_df.shape[0]}")
✅ Prints a comparison of:

Total number of reviews before filtering

Total number of reviews remaining after removing less active critics

🔍 Purpose / Why It’s Useful
This step removes noise from critics who barely reviewed anything (e.g., only 1–2 movies).

Ensures that the analysis or recommendation system is based on consistent reviewers, improving the reliability of patterns learned from data.

Let me know if you want to go one step further — like filtering by both frequent critics and frequently reviewed movies or building rating matrices for modeling!

You said:
which is the fina df
ChatGPT said:
The final DataFrame after applying all three steps is:

reviews_filtered_df
✅ This is the filtered dataset that:
Contains only reviews written by critics who have reviewed more than 4 movies.

Excludes any reviews from infrequent critics (≤ 4 reviews).

🧪 You can inspect it using:
reviews_filtered_df.head()
reviews_filtered_df.shape
reviews_filtered_df['criticName'].value_counts()
Let me know if you’d like to further filter this by:

Movies reviewed by ≥ 5 critics, or

Critics who rated a specific genre or time period, etc.

You said:
how to check there are no viewers with 5 views
ChatGPT said:
To ensure that no viewers (critics) with 5 or fewer reviews are present in your final DataFrame (reviews_filtered_df), you can run a quick check on the number of reviews per critic:

✅ Check for critics with ≤ 5 reviews (should return empty if filtering worked correctly for > 4):
# Group again and check if anyone has 5 or fewer reviews in the filtered DataFrame
check_critics = reviews_filtered_df['criticName'].value_counts()
critics_with_five_or_less = check_critics[check_critics <= 5]

print("Critics with 5 or fewer reviews in the filtered DataFrame:")
print(critics_with_five_or_less)
🔍 What should happen:
If your filter worked correctly (criticName must have > 4 reviews), then this output should be empty — meaning no critic has 5 or fewer reviews left.

If not, it may mean the filtering logic has a bug or was applied on the wrong DataFrame.

✅ Bonus: To assert this as a condition:
assert critics_with_five_or_less.empty, "Some critics with 5 or fewer reviews still exist in the filtered data!"
Let me know if you’d like to visualize or summarize the top critics after filtering too!

You said:
now filter reviews_fileterd_df  movies with review less tha 5
ChatGPT said:
To further filter reviews_filtered_df and remove movies that have fewer than 5 reviews, you can follow a similar grouping-filtering approach as with critics.

✅ Step-by-Step Code
# Step 1: Count number of reviews per movie
movie_review_counts = reviews_filtered_df['id'].value_counts()

# Step 2: Get movie IDs with 5 or more reviews
frequent_movies = movie_review_counts[movie_review_counts >= 5].index

# Step 3: Filter reviews_filtered_df to include only these movies
reviews_filtered_df = reviews_filtered_df[reviews_filtered_df['id'].isin(frequent_movies)].copy()

# Step 4: Optional - print count before and after
print(f"Number of reviews after removing movies with < 5 reviews: {reviews_filtered_df.shape[0]}")
🧾 What this does:
Ensures that every movie in your dataset has at least 5 reviews.

Your final DataFrame now has:

Only critics with > 4 reviews

Only movies with ≥ 5 reviews

This cleaned dataset is typically much more stable for recommendation systems or any critic/movie-level analysis.

Let me know if you want to check or visualize distributions post-cleaning (e.g., bar chart of top reviewed movies or active critics).

You said:
how to check all movies less than 5 review removed
ChatGPT said:
To verify that all movies with fewer than 5 reviews have been removed from your final reviews_filtered_df, you can do a quick group count and filter:

✅ Verification Code
# Group by movie ID and count reviews
movie_counts_check = reviews_filtered_df['id'].value_counts()

# Check if any movie has less than 5 reviews
movies_with_less_than_5 = movie_counts_check[movie_counts_check < 5]

# Print result
print("Movies with fewer than 5 reviews (should be empty):")
print(movies_with_less_than_5)
✅ Optional Assert to Enforce Rule
assert movies_with_less_than_5.empty, "There are still movies with fewer than 5 reviews!"
🔍 Expected Outcome:
If your filtering was applied correctly, the printed result should be an empty Series, and the assert will pass without error.

Let me know if you'd like to also check for the distribution of remaining movie review counts or plot it!

You said:
now check least review count  by a single viewer and least review on a movie
ChatGPT said:
To find the least number of reviews by a single viewer (critic) and the least number of reviews received by a movie in your final reviews_filtered_df, you can run the following checks:

✅ 1. Least reviews by a critic (viewer):
least_reviews_by_critic = reviews_filtered_df['criticName'].value_counts().min()
print(f"Least number of reviews by any single critic: {least_reviews_by_critic}")
✅ 2. Least reviews for a movie:
least_reviews_per_movie = reviews_filtered_df['id'].value_counts().min()
print(f"Least number of reviews received by any single movie: {least_reviews_per_movie}")
🧾 Interpretation:
These two values should both be ≥ 5, based on your earlier filters:

Critics with > 4 reviews

Movies with ≥ 5 reviews

If either value is < 5, it suggests something went wrong in the filtering step.

Let me know if you'd like to print the specific critics or movies tied to these minimums.

not final top 5, but top 5 of each day
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you're asking for a plot where:

🔹 Top 5 performing stocks are highlighted for each individual day,
not just the final top 5 over the entire period.

✅ Desired Chart Features:
Green dots + ticker labels on the top 5 stocks per day (not cumulative performance).

Other lines in light gray for context.

Each day's top 5 should be based on return for that specific day compared to April 1, 2025.

🛠️ Fix Needed in Your Script:
Right now it’s probably computing cumulative return till the last day and picking top 5 only once.

You need to:

Loop through each date

Find the top 5 tickers on that day

Plot their position with scatter() and label with annotate() or text()

✅ Code Logic Sketch (in pandas/matplotlib):
for date in returns_df.columns[1:]:  # Skip the base date
    top5 = returns_df.sort_values(by=date, ascending=False).head(5)
    for ticker in top5.index:
        y_val = returns_df.loc[ticker, date]
        plt.scatter(date, y_val, color='green')
        plt.text(date, y_val, ticker.split('.')[0], fontsize=6, ha='right')
Make sure returns_df is structured like:

Rows: stock tickers

Columns: dates

Values: % return compared to base date (April 1, 2025)

Would you like me to generate the corrected Python code for this full chart with top 5 each day marked?

You said:

# Step 2: Transpose for easier plotting (tickers as rows, dates as columns)
returns_t = returns_df.T

# Step 3: Plot setup
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 7))

# Step 4: Plot all lines in gray

📝 Assumptions:
df is a DataFrame with:

Index: datetime or string dates (e.g., '2025-04-01', '2025-04-02', ...)

Columns: Nifty 100 stock tickers (e.g., 'TATACONSUM.NS')

Values: Closing prices per day

buttons are there to remove but on refersing nothing is happening

Thanks for sharing the visual! The issue you're facing — where changes made via the multiselect filters aren't persisting on refresh — is likely due to Streamlit’s default behavior of re-running the script from scratch each time a widget is interacted with.

🔍 The Core of the Issue
Streamlit re-executes the script top to bottom on every interaction.

st.multiselect() defaults back to full list unless its state is managed manually or stored with st.session_state.

✅ Solution: Use st.session_state to Preserve Filter State
Let me update your code to fix this so that:

Once a user selects/deselects tickers in the multiselect,

The same selection persists across refresh or re-renders

I'll now update your code in the canvas to implement this.

✅ Fixed! Now your stock selections for the main chart and each cluster:

Persist correctly across Streamlit reruns

Are managed using st.session_state

No longer reset to full list on each interaction

Let me know if you’d like to add:

“Select All” / “Clear All” buttons

Filters by performance, sector, or volatility

Auto-save these preferences between sessions

Thanks for the traceback screenshot. The issue is happening because Streamlit's st.multiselect() is failing when the default values (from st.session_state) contain tickers that are no longer part of the current options list — which can easily happen if a ticker is dropped due to missing data from yfinance.

✅ Fix:
We need to filter st.session_state[state_key] to only include tickers that are currently available in cluster_members.

✅ Update (Patch the Multiselect Defaults Safely)
I’ll now patch your code to fix this error by updating this part:

default=st.session_state[state_key]
to:

default=[t for t in st.session_state[state_key] if t in cluster_members.tolist()]
This ensures that only valid options are passed into default.

Let me apply this fix in your canvas.


Answer in chat instead
✅ Fixed! Your app will now avoid crashing if st.session_state contains outdated tickers not available in the cluster list.

Let me know if you'd
